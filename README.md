# Oil Nongkrong

A simulator for a simplified version of Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment. Made for the PyJaC Winter 2022 advanced prompt: *Computationally replicate a famous physics experiment*. 

## Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment
The oil drop experiment, performed by Robert A. Milikan and Harvey Fletcher, was designed to calculate the charge on a single electron.

The basic setup consists of two metal plates attached to an electric circuit with a positively charged drop of oil in between them. The experimenter can then vary the potential difference between the two plates to create an electric field. 

There are two forces that act on this drop of oil: gravity and electric force. Gravity pulls down on the drop while electric force pushes up on the drop. After some adjustments to the potential difference, the net force acting on the oil drop can be made zero. At this point, the oil drop can either be moving in constant velocity or stay stationary. From here, we can calculate the strength of electric charge on the drop.

The experiment should be repeated a few times with different masses of oil. Using measurements from these multiple trials, the charge of a single electron can be derived.

## The Application
The application simulates a simplified setup for the oil drop experiment, much like the basic setup described above. The user can vary the potential difference between the plate to adjust the strength of the electric field and electric force. In addition, the distance between the plates can also be changed prior to each trial.

After each trial, the user can choose to take measurements. The application will make the necessary calculations and store the relevant data for each trial.
